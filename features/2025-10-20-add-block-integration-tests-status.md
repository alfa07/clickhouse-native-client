# Block Integration Tests - Final Status

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Branch:** add-block-integration-tests
**PR:** #18
**Status:** IN PROGRESS - Test implementation needs revision

## Current Status

✅ Successfully created 51 integration test files
✅ Updated CI configuration
✅ All unit tests pass (187/187)
✅ Code properly formatted
✅ Fixed compilation errors in numeric tests
❌ Integration tests failing due to test design issue

## Issue Identified

The boundary tests insert multiple single-row blocks separately, then query all rows. ClickHouse returns results potentially split across multiple blocks, but tests only read from `blocks[0]`.

**Error:**
```
index out of bounds: the len is 1 but the index is 1
at src/column/numeric.rs:165:18
in test_uint32_block_insert_boundary
```

**Root Cause:**
- Test inserts 4 separate blocks (4 separate `client.insert()` calls)
- Query returns `total_rows() = 4` but data may be split across multiple result blocks
- Code only reads from `blocks[0]` which may only have 1 row
- Accessing `result_col.at(1)` fails because blocks[0] has only 1 element

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Insert all rows in single block (RECOMMENDED)
Change boundary tests to create one block with all test case rows instead of inserting each row separately.

### Option 2: Accumulate rows from all blocks
Read rows from all result blocks, not just `blocks[0]`.

## Recommendation

Use **Option 1** as it:
- Matches the test intent (testing block insertion with multiple values)
- Simpler implementation
- Consistent with basic test pattern
- More realistic usage pattern

## Files Needing Updates

All 51 integration_block test files need their `boundary` test functions updated to insert all test cases in a single block instead of looping with separate inserts.

## Next Steps

1. Update all 51 test files to fix boundary test pattern
2. Run integration tests locally to verify
3. Push fixes
4. Monitor CI until green
5. Land PR

## Summary

This feature adds comprehensive test coverage but needs a pattern fix in the boundary tests. The tests are well-structured and will provide excellent coverage once the multi-block result handling is corrected.
